# Frontend Phase Notes

Phase 1 established backend and monorepo foundations.
Phase 2 and 3 backend APIs are now available for frontend integration:

- Seller flow: onboarding/auth, store creation, dashboard summary, product creation.
- Buyer flow: store browsing, product listing, product detail, and cart endpoints.

Next frontend implementation step is wiring UI screens to these APIs.
